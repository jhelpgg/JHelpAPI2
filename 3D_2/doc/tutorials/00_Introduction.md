Package presentation
--------------------

These **package** is *dedicated* to a 3D-engine to show 3D scenes.
It is a scene graph based on LWJGL. The 3D is rendered by OpenGL, sounds by OpenAL (MP3 are decoded via JavaZoom)

Aim of this tutorials
---------------------

The goal of those tutorials is to explain how to use the 3D-engine.
We try by simple examples to show the different possibility of the 3D-engine.
We hope to give you the desire to go further in 3D.

These package depends on some utilities package, that you can download in our Github with their own documentation.
